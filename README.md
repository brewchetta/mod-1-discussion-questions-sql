# SQL Discussion Questions

## Talk with your group and write a few sentences about each question

1 . When you tweet a tweet, your tweet is available to THE WHOLE INTERNET
FOREVER. Why doesn't your tweet disappear after you post it?

2 . When you enter your debit card into an ATM, how is your account identified?
How does the bank associate that card number to your account? How does your bank
store your account information? Do you think your address and phone number are
stored the same way as your account number and how much money you have?

3 . Translate this into your own words:

```sql
SELECT * FROM artists WHERE name='Kid Cudi'
```

4 . Define "Persistence" in programming. Does the `@@all` class variable we have
   been using in our code meet all the criteria for "persistence".

5. Translate this into your own words:

```sql
INSERT INTO artists (name, genre) VALUES ('Taylor Swift', 'Pop');
```

6. What is a Primary Key? Do we manually insert them into our database? 
What issues might we run into if we didn't have them?

7. Translate this into your own words:

```sql
DELETE FROM artists WHERE name = 'Kanye';
```

8. Translate this into your own words:

```sql
SELECT * FROM artists WHERE name LIKE 'k%'
```

9. How do you think Yelp can show you all Latin Restaurants, with a $$ price
rating, in the Financial District, which have higher than a 3 star rating?
As a stretch, do you think you can write that SQL command?

10. Work with your group to come up with the SQL command to UPDATE Taylor Swift 
so that her genre is 'Country Pop' instead of 'Pop'.
