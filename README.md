# SQL Discussion Questions

## Talk with your group and write a few sentences about each question

1 . When you tweet a tweet, your tweet is available to THE WHOLE INTERNET
FOREVER. Why doesn't your tweet disappear after you post it? How does it stay on
Twitter and stay associated to ​_your_​ account?

2 . When you enter your debit card into an ATM, how is your account identified?
How does the bank associate that card number to your account? How does your bank
store your account information? Do you think your address and phone number are
stored the same way as your account number and how much money you have?

 3 . How does Tinder know you are who you say you are when you open your
 application, type your password, and begin to swipe insatiably? How does it
 know that you and your latest match swiped right on each other, and that is
 wasn't someone other _John/Jane/J. Doe_?

4 . How do you think Yelp can show you all Latin Restaurants, with a $$ price
rating, in the Financial District, which have higher than a 3 star rating?

5 . Translate this into your own words:

```sql
SELECT * FROM artists WHERE name='Kid Cudi'
```

6 . Define "Persistence" in programming. Does the `@@all` class variable we have
   been using in our code meet all the criteria for "persistence".

7. Translate this into your own words:

```sql
INSERT INTO artists (name, genre) VALUES ('Taylor Swift', 'Pop');
```

8. What is a Primary Key? Do we manually insert them into our database? What issues might we run into if we didn't have them?

9. Translate this into your own words:

```sql
DELETE FROM artists WHERE name = 'Kanye';
```

10. Translate this into your own words:

```sql
SELECT * FROM artists WHERE name LIKE 'k%'
```

11. Work with your group to come up with the SQL command to UPDATE Taylor Swift so that her genre is 'Country Pop' instead of 'Pop'.
